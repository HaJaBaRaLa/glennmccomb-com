summary: An iPhone app to help maintain your desired fitness level
---

FitBugg is a location-based fitness app which connects personal trainers with fitness-seeking individuals in their area.

Fitness session organisers create events which fitness-seekers book in to and attend. All of this is managed within the framework of the app.

## My role

My role began in late February 2014 as UI designer. I was given a basic product specification document outlining desired functionality and tasked with bringing it to life.

The deliverables were logo design, wireframes, high-res mockups, all creative assets sliced up as PNGs and an interactive prototype.

This would provide an iOS developer with a concise development roadmap and a thorough understanding of the app's business logic.

## App architecture

Before opening Photoshop, I began creating a basic system overview (traditionally known as a site map).

This gave me the basis to begin sketching pen and paper UI wireframes.

## Sketching

Once I had sketched low-fi wireframes and established the structure of the app, I began exploring individual screens in more detail.

In most cases the final wireframes and high-res mockups only differed slightly from these initial sketches.

I was able to quickly prioritise important information and set the core visual hierarchy on all screens.

## Wireframes

To communicate the fundamental structure of the app and its screens, I created over 100 wireframes in OmniGraffle and compiled them in a detailed product spec document.

I might never speak to the developer of this project so it was important that all features and interactions were explained in detail.

## Logo Design

### First draft

My initial approach to the logo utilised a dumbbell in combination with a location pin.

This was a cute way to communicate what the app was about, but it was ambiguous and the weight lifting motif was too masculine.

### Second draft

My next iteration maintained the location pin, but tackled it from a more human perspective. This was ultimately too feminine and the detail was difficult to make out at low resolutions.

### Final concept

Next I further developed the stretching concept, which visually describes exercise in a non-masculine way. We focused on the stretching pose but went with a bubbly, playful stick figure.

## The FitBugg brand

In the early going my working colour was a grassy-green which would map to the outdoor park location of many PT sessions. Over time this began to look dull, and in experimenting with the icon we settled on a vibrant blue.

### Typography

I wanted the typography to match the fun style of the icon. I mocked up various options but ultimately decided on [Museo Sans Rounded](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans-rounded/) because it felt both solid and strong while maintaining the rounded style of the stick-figure.

### Colours

A colour palette was developed and used throughout the app. This included the blues shown below, along with a suite of blue-tinted grays and success and fail colours.

## Hi-res mockups

High res mockups were designed using Photoshop, which I've used on a daily basis for over 10 years. With wireframes as a guide I was able to move very quickly through all screens.
