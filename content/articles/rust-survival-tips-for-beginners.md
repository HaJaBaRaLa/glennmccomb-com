{{< lead >}}A grand introduction.{{< /lead >}}

Rust is currently the most popular title in a new breed of first-person survival games first pioneered by [DayZ](https://www.bistudio.com/games/dayz). The learning curve is savage and there is literally no on-boarding at all. The game is in [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) and [the devs](http://www.facepunchstudios.com/) are planning to improve the experience for first-timers but for now you're on your own. 

The first thing to know about Rust is that you will probably die. A lot. It's a grind and the more loot you gather the more frustrating it is. It's a part of the game though so don't sweat it. And don't expect any sympathy from other players.

## The Basics

Once you've banged on some trees and [nodes](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Rocks) with your rock and collected some hemp there are a few items you'll want to craft (via "Q" or via the quick craft menu):

- [Paper Map](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Paper_Map) <small>5 wood</small>
- [Stone Hatchet](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Hatchet) <small>200 wood, 100 stone</small>
- [Stone Pick Axe](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Pick_Axe) <small>250 wood, 125 stone</small>
- [Bow and arrows](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Hunting_Bow) <small>200 wood, 50 cloth</small>
- [Wooden spear](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wooden_Spear) <small>300 wood</small>
- [Bandages](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Bandage) <small>4 cloth</small>

These items help you farm resources, heal yourself and kill animals and other players. My preferred weapon is the bow but the spear is handy for close quarters combat and for popping barrels.

You'll notice I've left clothes off the list. At this early stage unless you're in the snow there's not much point using cloth to craft clothes. You're better off saving it for a bow and sleeping bag (80 cloth combined).

## First things first

A couple of key objectives in the early game:

1. Find an area to build and get a sleeping bag and stash down.
2. Build a starter base and add a key lock / code lock.
3. Craft a furnace.

There's a lot more to it than this and I'll go into the details below.


## Finding an area to build

You can build just about anywhere on the map (besides around [monuments](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Monuments) and [caves](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Cave)) but some areas are usually quieter than others. Most monuments draw a crowd and you'll get picked off while trying to make your start.

A good strategy is to quickly bang a tree after you've spawned and craft some paper and then a map. Run away from the beach so you don't get harassed by other nakeds and head inland away from monuments. 

Part of the fun of Rust is learning the different characteristics of each area so don't be too fussed where you end up. However, initially the snow is challenging because you will die of cold overnight unless you have clothes and a fire.

I've found the north just south of the snow to be a good place to start.


## Getting a sleeping bag and stash down

Once you've found an area to build you'll want to get a [sleeping bag](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Sleeping_Bag) down. Find some tall grass or bushes and plonk it down. This allows you to respawn in the area rather than on a random beach. 

Next up craft a [small stash](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Small_Stash) and pop it down somewhere distinct that you will be able to remember. You will need to be able to find it to dump resources or if you respawn. The reason this is important is that you're going to bury your stash underground where no one can see it (including yourself). Because of the difficulties of locating a stash some people prefer a [wooden storage box](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wood_Storage_Box) but this is much easier for other players to find - unless you find a box-sized rock to hide it in (which actually works a treat if you can pull it off).

Put your main resources in your stash (wood, stone, metal ore, sulfur ore and high quality metal ore) and continue foraging. You'll want to accumulate a decent amount of loot along the lines of:

- 2-4k wood
- 1-4k stone
- 300-500 metal ore
- At least 30 cloth for a sleeping bag

Of course the more you have the better but this is enough for your starter base.


## Getting metal fragments

Early on metal frags are difficult to come by. Occasionally a barrel will drop 10-15 of them but that's unusual. However, they're very important to help you get a code lock on the door of your starter base (100 metal frags). Code locks are way more secure than key locks so if you're anywhere near a lighthouse or harbour it's worth your while finding a recycling station and cashing in any components you find. 

Gears, pipes, springs and semi-automatic bodies are crucial for later on but propane tanks and sheet metal will give you 50 and 100 metal frags respectively without mortgaging your future too much.

<small>NOTE: I mention the harbour recycler because harbours have lower tier loot crates and are less attractive to potentially experienced (and probably armed) players.</small>


## Building a starter base

Don't get too carried away building your first base. Your main priority here is to get a safe place to store your loot.
