{{< lead >}}[Rust](http://rust.facepunch.com/) is one of the most popular titles in a new breed of first-person survival games pioneered by [DayZ](https://www.bistudio.com/games/dayz). The learning curve is savage and there is very little on-boarding (at the moment).{{< /lead >}}

Rust is in [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) and [Facepunch](http://www.facepunchstudios.com/) are planning to improve the experience for first-timers before officially launching. But for now you're on your own.

The first thing to know about Rust is that you will die. A lot. And that's ok. It's a grind and the more loot you've gathered when you die the more frustrating it is. It's a part of the game though so don't sweat it, and don't expect sympathy from other players.

<small>**NOTE:** This article is written at the time of [devblog 192](https://rust.facepunch.com/blog/devblog-192/) and may be out of date and inaccurate after future updates.</small>

## Choosing a server

In order to figure out the mechanics of the game a quiet server with less than 50 players is a good place to start. Intuition would suggest Facepunch's official servers are the safest place to start but they're riddled with cheaters and attract a less friendly crowd. 

A well maintained community server will keep tabs on cheaters and police players who are abusive or disrespectful. If you're playing on your own, look for solo/duo/trio servers as they restrict players to small groups and mean you'll avoid large clans and zergs.

When you're learning the ropes other players are usually more hindrance than help so don't be scared to jump on an empty community server.

## The basics

Once you've banged on a few trees and [nodes](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Rocks) with your rock and collected some hemp (cloth) there are a few items you'll want to craft:

* [Stone Hatchet](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Hatchet) <small>200 wood, 100 stone</small>
* [Stone Pick Axe](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Pick_Axe) <small>200 wood, 100 stone</small>
* [Bow](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Hunting_Bow) <small>200 wood, 50 cloth</small>
* [Arrows](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wooden_Arrow) <small>25 wood, 10 stone</small>
* [Wooden spear](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wooden_Spear) <small>300 wood</small>
* [Bandages](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Bandage) <small>4 cloth</small>

These items help you farm resources, kill things and heal yourself. My preferred weapon is the bow but the spear is handy for close quarters combat and for popping barrels. Press "G" to see the world map and figure out where you are.

You'll notice I've left clothes off the list. At this early stage unless you're in the snow there's not much point using your cloth to craft clothes. You're better off saving it for a bow and sleeping bag (50 and 30 cloth respectively).

## Eating

If you don't eat you will starve and die so finding food is important. There are a number of ways to satisfy your hunger:

* Pick corn, pumpkins and mushrooms.
* Harvest desert cactus for cactus flesh.
* Find small food containers near monuments and mines.
* Kill animals with a weapon (bow / spear) and roast their flesh on a campfire. <small>Try to avoid eating raw meat.</small>
* Killing other humans and roasting their flesh. <small>Note that this will heavily dehydrate you.</small>
* Catching fish with a [fishing trap](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Survival_Fish_Trap).

### Naturally growing food

The easiest of these is picking vegetables. Corn and pumpkins grow alongside rivers (usually near the river mouth), and mushrooms grow in the dirt in forested areas. 

In the desert you'll get a small amount of cloth and cactus flesh when you bang on cacti with a rock / hatchet.

### Food containers

Food containers are a great kick start but the monuments and mines that they grow around tend to be more populated.

### Animals

Killing animals is tricky because the majority of them will either run away faster than you can chase them or fight back with often fatal consequences. Even boars can kill you if all you have is your rock. If you manage to kill an animal, for maximum yield, butcher it with a [bone knife](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Bone_Knife) which you can craft for 30 bone fragments.

### Fishing

TL;DR: Don't bother fishing.

[Fish traps](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Survival_Fish_Trap) are rarely used in Rust. I've tried them myself once to get a handle on the mechanics but a lot can go wrong and the cost/benefit makes them barely worthwhile. They cost 200 wood and 5 cloth to craft and you will need bait (mushrooms, corn, etc). Place your trap on a beach, load it with bait and wait ~10 minutes. 

If you're lucky you'll catch a trout. If you're not, you'll catch minnows. Cooked trout is very nutritious and you'll get some bonus animal fat but minnows are not good.

{{< figure src="/img/uploads/article-rust-survival-tips-fish-trap.jpg" caption="A pair of fish traps standing out like dog's balls." >}}

The problem with fishing is that while you're waiting to catch a fish, any other player can either take your bait, destroy your trap or steal your fish once it's trapped. They're also obvious as fuck sitting in the beach so there's no hiding them.

## Early game objectives

A few key objectives in the early game:

1. Find an area to build
2. Get a sleeping bag and stash down
3. Build a starter base
4. Craft a furnace

There's a lot more to it than this and I'll go into detail below.

### Finding an area to build

You can build just about anywhere on the map (besides around [monuments](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Monuments) and [caves](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Cave)) but some areas are generally quieter than others. Most monuments draw a crowd and you'll get picked off while trying to make your start.

A good strategy is to quickly bang a tree after you've spawned and craft some paper and then a map. Run away from the beach so you don't get harassed by other nakeds and head inland away from monuments. 

Part of the fun of Rust is learning the different characteristics of each area so don't be too fussed where you end up. However, initially the snow is challenging because you will die of cold overnight unless you have clothes and a fire.

I've found the northern parts of the map just south of the snow to be a good starter location.

### Getting a sleeping bag and stash down

Once you've found an area to build you'll want to get a [sleeping bag](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Sleeping_Bag) down. Find some tall grass or bushes and plonk it down. This allows you to respawn at your bag rather than on a random beach. 

Next up craft a [small stash](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Small_Stash) and pop it down somewhere distinct that you will be able to remember. You'll need to be able to find it to dump resources or if you respawn. The reason this is important is that you're going to bury your stash underground where no one can see it (including yourself). To access your stash again you need to look down at the ground where it's buried for several seconds.

Because of the difficulties of locating a stash some people prefer a [wooden storage box](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wood_Storage_Box). While this is easier for you to find, it's also much easier for other players to find. Note that it's possible to find a box-sized rock to hide your box which works a treat if you can pull it off.

{{< figure src="/img/uploads/article-rust-survival-tips-hidden-chest.gif" caption="My very poor attempt at hiding a wooden chest." >}}

Periodically dump your main resources in your stash (wood, stone, metal ore, sulfur ore and high quality metal ore) and continue foraging. You'll want to accumulate a decent amount of loot along the lines of:

* 2-4k wood
* 1-4k stone
* 300-500 metal ore
* At least 30 cloth for a sleeping bag

The more the better, but this is enough for your starter base.

### Metal frags

Early on metal fragments are difficult to come by. Occasionally a barrel will drop 10-15 of them but that's unusual. You can get metal frags by smelting metal ore in a small furnace but you need 50 [low grade fuel](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Low_Grade_Fuel) for a [furnace](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Furnace) and that's a challenge in itself. 

However, metal frags are very important to help [code lock](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Code_Lock) the door of your starter base (100 metal frags). Code locks are way more secure than [key locks](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Lock). A good way to get metal early on is using a recycler. These can be found at most monuments, so if you're anywhere near a lighthouse, harbour, supermarket or gas station it's worth cashing in any components you've managed to find. 

{{< figure src="/img/uploads/article-rust-survival-tips-lighthouse-recycler.jpg" caption="The recycler at the lighthouse." >}}

Gears, pipes, springs and semi-automatic bodies will be useful very soon but you won't miss propane tanks and sheet metal and they'll give you 50 and 100 metal frags respectively.

<small>NOTE: I mention these monuments because they have lower tier loot crates and are less attractive to potentially experienced (and probably armed) players.</small>

Another sneaky great source of metal frags are empty bean and tuna cans which will give you 15 and 10 frags respectively when you roast them in a camp fire.

## Building a starter base

Don't get too carried away building your first base. Your main priority here is safely securing your loot so you can build up your gear and start causing mayhem for other players.

The cheapest and most common starter base is a single square foundation with an adjoining triangle foundation (commonly referred to as a 1x1). The square foundation has one door leading to the triangle foundation, which in turn has one door leading to the outside world. The triangle creates an airlock allowing you to "safely" leave your base without other players jumping in and grabbing your main loot.

To get your head around base building YouTube is your friend. There are a ton of great base builders out there but for your basic "shit shack" I found [Tiny Pirate's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYS98Ht54rwgF47D4K3AvCw) starter base showdown to be the most useful. Check it out.

For some additional 1x1 layout ideas I also recommend checking out [Tiny Pirate's vid comparing 1x1 layouts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8eA0uVMO1s).

### Another sleeping bag

You should already have a bag outside your base, but it's essential that you also have one on the inside. You'll want to be able to safely respawn in your base if you die. This is particularly important if you only have a key lock because you can very easily get locked out of your own base. And even a wooden door is a royal pain in the arse to destroy with stone tools (don't even bother).

### Building materials

To start building you will need [building plan](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Building_Plan) and a [hammer](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Hammer). The building plan allows you to place twig foundations, walls, floors and more. The hammer allows you to upgrade your twig to wood, stone, metal and armoured. 

When placing twig walls, notice that on one side there are criss-crossed logs forming an X. This is the wall's soft side and you don't want it external facing. When placing twig structures, press R to rotate them. If you place something incorrectly you can rotate it using the hammer, but only for a limited time.

Twig is _very_ easy to destroy so at the very least you should upgrade your twig to wood. But wood is vulnerable too. It can be burnt using a [flame thrower](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Flame_Thrower) and hatchets will eventually break it. Stone is what you should be aiming for. Just make sure you place your walls strong-side out or they can be pick-axed.

### Tool cupboard

Placing a [tool cupboard (TC)](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Tool_Cupboard) in your base means only you - or anyone else who has access to your TC - can build within a certain radius of where your TC is placed. Other players can build some types of twig near your base but they can't upgrade it. This prevents players from griefing your base by building walls around your door. Place your TC in one of the back corners of your 1x1 and authorise yourself. Having TC auth allows you to destroy structures, but only for 10 minutes after they are placed. 

### Key locks

If you don't yet have the metal frags for a [code lock](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Code_Lock) that's fine, a [key lock](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Lock) will do the trick temporarily. Just be aware that key locks are very insecure for the following reasons:

* If you're killed while carrying your key near your base your key lets anyone into base.
* If you lose your key outside your base you won't be able to get back in unless you have a spare hidden outside. And if you don't have a spare key inside your base you can respawn to a bag but you won't be able to open your door.
* Other players can craft a key and there's a slim chance it will open your lock. This is called [lock picking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP3cYn4RonM). If someone creates enough keys their chances of picking your lock increases (chances of a match are estimated at 1/100).

To avoid disaster when using a key lock:

* Always have a spare key and sleeping bag in your base.
* When you go outside hide your key in a stash.
* Get a code lock as soon as you can even if it's on a wooden door.

## Crafting a furnace

Crafting a furnace is one of the most important early game milestones. Once you have a furnace you can begin to smelt metal and sulphur. This is particularly vital if you don't yet have a code lock on your base.

The biggest obstacle to crafting a furnace is the 50 low grade fuel. This can be difficult to find early on. Here's how you can find it:

* Killing animals and harvesting them for animal fat (x3 animal fat + x1 cloth = 1 low grade). Bears are the best and if you take one down early on you are set.
* Cracking red oil barrels. This usually gets you 5 low grade and 15 crude oil.
* Looting the mining carts found outside mines (can yield 15-20 low grade). Make sure you take low grade from the [candle hat](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Candle_Hat) and [miners hat](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Miners_Hat).
* Catching [trout](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Small_Trout) in a [fishing trap](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Survival_Fish_Trap) will get you 8 animal fat. This seems like a lot of effort when anyone else can loot your trap before you get to it.
* Refining [crude oil](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Crude_Oil) via an [small oil refinery](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Small_Oil_Refinery). You can craft an oil refinery yourself or they can be found at certain monuments.

<small>TIP: Craft a [bone knife](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Bone_Knife) as soon as you can for max efficiency when harvesting animals.</small>
