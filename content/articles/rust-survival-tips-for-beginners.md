{{< lead >}}A grand introduction.{{< /lead >}}

Rust is currently the most popular title in a new breed of first-person survival games first pioneered by [DayZ](https://www.bistudio.com/games/dayz). The learning curve is savage and there is literally no on-boarding at all. The game is in [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) and [the devs](http://www.facepunchstudios.com/) are planning to improve the experience for first-timers but for now you're on your own. 

The first thing to know about Rust is that you will probably die. A lot. It's a grind and the more loot you gather the more frustrating it is. It's a part of the game though so don't sweat it. And don't expect any sympathy from other players.

## The Basics

Once you've banged on some trees and [nodes](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Rocks) with your rock there are a few items you'll want to craft (by pressing Q or via the quick craft menu):

- [Stone Hatchet](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Hatchet) <small>- 200 wood, 100 stone</small>
- [Stone Pick Axe](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Pick_Axe) <small>- 250 wood, 125 stone</small>
- [Bow](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Hunting_Bow). <small>- 200 wood, 50 cloth</small>



## First things first

A couple of key objectives in the early game:

1. Find an area to build and get a sleeping bag and stash down.
2. Build a starter base and add a key lock / code lock.
3. Craft a furnace.

There's a lot more to it than this and I'll go into the details below.

## Finding an area to build

You can build just about anywhere on the map (besides around [monuments](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Monuments) and [caves](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Cave)) but some areas are quieter than others. Most monuments draw a crowd of people searching for components and you'll get picked off while you're trying to get up and running. 

A good strategy is to bang
