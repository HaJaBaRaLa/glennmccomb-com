{{< lead >}}[Rust](http://rust.facepunch.com/) is one of the most popular titles in a new breed of first-person survival games pioneered by [DayZ](https://www.bistudio.com/games/dayz). The learning curve is savage and there is very little on-boarding (at the moment). The game is in [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) and [the devs](http://www.facepunchstudios.com/) are planning to improve the experience for first-timers before officially launching but for now you're on your own. {{< /lead >}}

Rust is one of the most popular titles in a new breed of first-person survival games pioneered by DayZ. The learning curve is savage and there is very little on-boarding (at the moment). The game is in [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) and [the devs](http://www.facepunchstudios.com/) are planning to improve the experience for first-timers before officially launching but for now you're on your own. 

The first thing to know about Rust is that you will die. A lot. And that's ok. It's a grind and the more loot you've gathered when you die the more frustrating it is. It's a part of the game though so don't sweat it, and don't expect sympathy from other players.

## The Basics

Once you've banged on a few trees and [nodes](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Rocks) with your rock and collected some hemp there are a few items you'll want to craft:

- [Paper Map](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Paper_Map) <small>5 wood</small>
- [Stone Hatchet](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Hatchet) <small>200 wood, 100 stone</small>
- [Stone Pick Axe](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_Pick_Axe) <small>250 wood, 125 stone</small>
- [Bow](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Hunting_Bow) <small>200 wood, 50 cloth</small>
- [Arrows](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wooden_Arrow) <small>25 wood, 10 stone</small>
- [Wooden spear](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wooden_Spear) <small>300 wood</small>
- [Bandages](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Bandage) <small>4 cloth</small>

<small>TIP: To access the crafting screen press "Q".</small>

These items help you farm resources, kill things and heal yourself. My preferred weapon is the bow but the spear is handy for close quarters combat and for popping barrels.

You'll notice I've left clothes off the list. At this early stage unless you're in the snow there's not much point using your cloth to craft clothes. You're better off saving it for a bow and sleeping bag (50 and 30 cloth respectively).

## Choosing a server

In order to figure out the mechanics of the game a quiet server with less than 50 players is a good place to start. Intuition would suggest Facepunch's official servers are the safest place to start but they're riddled with cheaters and attract a less friendly crowd. 

A well maintained community server will keep tabs on cheaters and police players who are abusive or disrespectful. If you're playing on your own, look for solo/duo/trio servers as they restrict players to small groups and mean you'll avoid large clans and zergs.

When you're learning the ropes other players are usually more hindrance than help. Don't be scared to jump on an empty community server.

## Early game objectives

A few key objectives in the early game:

1. Find an area to build
2. Get a sleeping bag and stash down
3. Build a starter base
4. Craft a furnace

There's a lot more to it than this and I'll go into detail below.


### Finding an area to build

You can build just about anywhere on the map (besides around [monuments](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Monuments) and [caves](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Cave)) but some areas are generally quieter than others. Most monuments draw a crowd and you'll get picked off while trying to make your start.

A good strategy is to quickly bang a tree after you've spawned and craft some paper and then a map. Run away from the beach so you don't get harassed by other nakeds and head inland away from monuments. 

Part of the fun of Rust is learning the different characteristics of each area so don't be too fussed where you end up. However, initially the snow is challenging because you will die of cold overnight unless you have clothes and a fire.

I've found the northern parts of the map just south of the snow to be a good starter location.


### Getting a sleeping bag and stash down

Once you've found an area to build you'll want to get a [sleeping bag](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Sleeping_Bag) down. Find some tall grass or bushes and plonk it down. This allows you to respawn in the area rather than on a random beach. 

Next up craft a [small stash](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Small_Stash) and pop it down somewhere distinct that you will be able to remember. You will need to be able to find it to dump resources or if you respawn. The reason this is important is that you're going to bury your stash underground where no one can see it (including yourself). 

Because of the difficulties of locating a stash some people prefer a [wooden storage box](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Wood_Storage_Box). While this is easier for you to find, it's also much easier for other players to find. Not that it's possible to find a box-sized rock to hide your box. This works a treat if you can pull it off.

Periodically dump your main resources in your stash (wood, stone, metal ore, sulfur ore and high quality metal ore) and continue foraging. You'll want to accumulate a decent amount of loot something along the lines of:

- 2-4k wood
- 1-4k stone
- 300-500 metal ore
- At least 30 cloth for a sleeping bag

The more the better but this is enough for your starter base.


### Getting metal frags

Early on metal fragments are difficult to come by. Occasionally a barrel will drop 10-15 of them but that's unusual. You can get metal frags by roasting metal ore but you need 50 [low grade fuel](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Low_Grade_Fuel) for a [furnace](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Furnace) and that's a challenge in itself. 

However, metal frags very important to help [code lock](http://rust.wikia.com/wiki/Code_Lock) the door of your starter base (100 metal frags). Code locks are way more secure than key locks so if you're anywhere near a lighthouse or harbour it's worth your while finding a recycling station and cashing in any components you find. 

Gears, pipes, springs and semi-automatic bodies will be useful very soon but you won't miss propane tanks and sheet metal and they'll give you 50 and 100 metal frags respectively.

<small>NOTE: I mention the harbour recycler because harbours have lower tier loot crates and are less attractive to potentially experienced (and probably armed) players.</small>


### Building a starter base

Don't get too carried away building your first base. Your main priority here is safely securing your loot so you can build up your gear and start causing mayhem.


### Crafting a furnace

This is one of the most important milestones in the early games. Once you have a furnace you can begin to smelt metal and sulphur.
