{{< lead >}}A grand introduction.{{< /lead >}}

Rust is currently the most popular title in a new breed of first-person survival games first pioneered by [DayZ](https://www.bistudio.com/games/dayz). The learning curve is savage and there is literally no on-boarding at all. The game is in [early access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access) and [the devs](http://www.facepunchstudios.com/) are planning to improve the experience for first-timers but for now you're on your own. 

## First things first

A couple of key objectives in the early game:

1. Find an area to build and get a sleeping bag and stash down.
2. Build a starter base and add a key lock / code lock.
3. Craft a furnace.

There's a lot more to it than this and I'll go into the details below.

## 1) Find an area to build



## 2) Build a starter base
